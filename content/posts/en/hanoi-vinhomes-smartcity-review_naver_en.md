# 🇻🇳 Real Review: Hanoi Vinhomes Smart City 🏙️

Hey travelers! LazyNomad here 😊  
Let me share my thoughts after visiting **The Victoria at Smart City, Hanoi**!

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- 🚉 Upcoming Metro Line 6 (3–5 mins walk)
- 🛍️ On-site facilities: gym, pool, shopping area
- 🏗️ Vinhomes’ signature mega complex + school zones
- 🏢 Unsold units available → negotiation possible!

## 🧭 Personal Impression

Honestly… it exceeded my expectations.  
As a **retirement home + rental investment**, it’s a strong candidate.  
Most impressive was the *pedestrian-friendly layout*.
