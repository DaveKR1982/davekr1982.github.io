## 1️⃣ The Victoria: A Real Walkthrough

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Tower Name | The Victoria, Vinhomes Smart City |
| Layout | 2-bedroom, ~63–65㎡ usable area |
| Key Appeal | Premium zone within Smart City (nearest to Metro line) |
| Amenities | Indoor pool, gym, mall, security, park access |
| Price (2025) | ~₩1.5–1.7억 (KRW) / $110–130k (USD) |

📸 *Real Visit*: June 2025 model house tour

## 2️⃣ Financial Independence Fit

- ✅ **Buy-to-live or rent hybrid**: Use personally for 6–9 months/year, rent out seasonally during Korean peak winter
- ✅ **All-cash possible**: For many FIRE aspirants, the $130k price point is within liquidation reach
- ✅ **Rental income (estimate)**: $400–600/month furnished, short-term lease
- ✅ **Resale liquidity**: Vingroup-backed assets historically hold up well, especially if tied to transit & school zones

> 🔁 Long-term ROI is not just capital gains but **mobility hedge + cost savings**.
