## 🛫 Prologue — Why Agoda Still Wins in Asia

In 2025, Agoda remains the *underrated gem* of hotel booking platforms — especially for travel in Southeast Asia.

✔️ Lower prices than Google or Booking.com (for Asia)  
✔️ Personalized deals via app + browser combo  
✔️ Surprising availability of local boutique hotels

> “Once you learn to break Agoda’s interface, it becomes a goldmine.”

## 1️⃣ Filters That Actually Work

Use these **exact filter combinations** to cut noise and expose real value.

| Filter Type | Setting |
|-------------|---------|
| Price | Sort by: Lowest Price + Rating ≥ 8.0 |
| Property Type | Only select: Hotels, Guesthouses (Uncheck Hostels) |
| Rating | Minimum ★3, Hide Unrated |
| Cancellation | Free Cancellation only (if < 7 days to trip) |
| Location | Use map tool + zoom into metro/transit hubs |

**Hidden Tip:** Many 3.5★+ hotels with new reviews are rebranded properties with deep discounts. Use this to your advantage.

## 2️⃣ Behavior-Based Discounts (Yes, They Exist)

Agoda tracks your behavior. Use it.

🧠 **Log in, browse multiple times across 2–3 days.**  
🧠 **Don’t book right away.** Let the algo bait you.  
🧠 **Use mobile app for final booking (extra 5–10 % off)**

> Try using two devices: desktop for research, phone for booking.

Also: Agoda PointsMax lets you earn miles (e.g. Korean Air SKYPASS) — combine with credit card points stacking.
