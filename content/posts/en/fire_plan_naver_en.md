## ✨ Prologue — Why FIRE Matters *Now*

Stuck wages, housing bubbles, and a life that feels increasingly *back-loaded.*  
A tailored FIRE strategy is the antidote: <u>**front-load freedom**</u> so you can work **because you want to, not because you must**.

> **2025 data point:** Median Seoul apartment price ₩1.26 b, median 30-something salary ₩46 m.  
> → Traditional retirement math is broken.

## 1️⃣ Audit → Trim → Redirect

| Phase | Action | Daily Tools | Target KPI |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Audit** | 3-month spending download | OpenBanking CSV → ChatGPT categorizer | 🎯 100 % visibility |
| **Trim** | Cut 20 % “zero-joy” expenses | Zero-based budget sheet | 🎯 +₩500 k/mo gap |
| **Redirect** | Automate surplus → ETFs | Korean 연금저축 + TIGER S&P500 | 🎯 15 % savings rate ↑ |

**Mini-case:** A 32-year-old who redirects ₩800 k/mo (7 % CAGR) ends with **₩2.1 b** in 20 years—enough to draw ₩7 m/yr at a 3.5 % SWR.

## 2️⃣ Income Expansion Flywheel

1. **Skill-stack** one marketable edge per year. *(Cloud Dev Ops → Terraform tutoring → Korean ↔ En freelancing).*  
2. **Side-gig** 10 hrs/wk = +₩1 m/mo.  
3. **Geo-arbitrage**: Remote work while living in Chiang Mai halves spending.

> **Flywheel law:** *If expenses fall while income rises, runway squares—not adds.*

## 3️⃣ Glidepath & Withdrawal Math

| Age | Portfolio Mix | Streams | Draw Rate |
|-----|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 45  | 60 % ETF / 20 % Bond / 20 % Cash | Side-gig + dividends | Reinvest |
| 55  | Add 국민연금 (projected ₩1.2 m/mo) | 3.5 % SWR |
| 60  | Private & retirement pensions kick in | 4 % SWR |

**Sequence-risk hedge:** Keep 24 months in short-term bond ladder.
